## Here is the drafted update for the next phase of the AstroCrown Monte Carlo simulation, incorporating BTC-backed rebuy logic and recalibrated volatility parameters:

# 🚀 Updated Monte Carlo Simulation Parameters (BTC-Rebuy Logic)
1. Simulation Objective
To evaluate ACROWN’s Anti-Crash System (ACS) under BTC-pegged rebuy conditions, testing:

Drawdown resilience

Recovery speed

Collapse probability

TWAP rebuy efficiency

# ⚙️ Core Simulation Inputs
Parameter	Description
Base Asset Volatility	BTC historical volatility (daily std dev ~4.8%)
Rebuy Trigger Logic	TWAP deviation > 6.5% from 7-day moving average
Rebuy Source	BTC reserves converted via TWAP oracle
Emission Floor	35% below last TWAP price
Roof Price	35% above last TWAP price
Tax Rate	1.67% (validated for optimal retention and growth)
Simulation Horizon	365 days, 10 million paths
Shock Events	Randomized 3σ volatility spikes every 30–90 days
Oracle Lag	2-hour delay modeled to simulate real-world latency
Reserve Refill Logic	BTC rebuy only if reserve < 60% and TWAP deviation persists > 6 hours
📊 Metrics to Be Recalculated
Metric	Description
Drawdown Reduction	% reduction in peak-to-trough decline with BTC rebuy
Recovery Time	Days to return to pre-drawdown price
Collapse Probability	Likelihood of price falling below emission floor
TWAP Efficiency	% of rebuy events that led to net price stabilization
Reserve Drain Risk	% of paths where BTC reserves were exhausted
#🧠 Ethical & Symbolic Audit
BTC as Ritual Anchor: BTC rebuy logic reflects symbolic grounding in dignity and scarcity.

TWAP Oracle Transparency: All oracle assumptions will be published and auditable.

NOVA Governance Layer: Will monitor rebuy decisions for ethical coherence and bias.

# 🧪 Next Steps
Code Update: Integrate BTC-TWAP rebuy logic into Python simulation framework.

NOVA Calibration: Define symbolic thresholds for rebuy ethics and reserve dignity.

Simulation Execution: Run 10M paths with TensorFlow parallelization.

Report Publication: Update Markdown report with new metrics and visualizations.

Would you like me to begin drafting the Python logic for the BTC-TWAP rebuy module next, or shall we first define the symbolic thresholds for NOVA’s ethical rebuy decisions?
